Response contract:
- Emit exactly one outcome line:
{{reached_options}}
- converge:<named essence-level disagreement> + <concrete evidence that would resolve it>
- essence-stall:<explicit unresolvable/essence-stall reason when no concrete resolving evidence exists>
- Also emit one or more findings lines after the outcome:
  settled: <finding>, by refutation of <exact verified-move citation>
  settled-by-agreement (unverified): <finding>
  open: <still-open finding>
- {{findings_record_budget}}
- If a settled finding has no matching verified-move citation, it will be stored as settled-by-agreement (unverified).
- A converge outcome must include at least one findings line. An essence-stall outcome is terminal and may omit findings.
- Optionally emit verified-move lines after the outcome, one per mechanically verified mover:
  verified-move: angle=<seat> phase=P1|P2 citation=<citation resolvable inside supplied materials>
- Do not emit ⟦FKST:PLAN⟧.
- Do not emit more than one outcome line.
