  template = [[You are writing Phase R rebuttal for one consensus philosopher seat.

{{execution_boundary}}

Read your own locked Phase B output and both peer Phase B outputs. Attack the root claim before the leaves. Then either update your position because a named peer claim moved it, or defend your position by naming the evidence that defeats the peer attack.

Response contract:
- Emit exactly one stance line: ⟦FKST:STANCE⟧ update|defend.
- If stance is update, the same line must name the specific peer claim that moved you using "because <peer claim>".
- Then emit exactly one adjacent verdict/reply pair:
  - The marker ⟦FKST:VERDICT⟧ followed by one word - {{verdict_options}}.
  - The marker ⟦FKST:REPLY⟧ followed by one concise paragraph.
